Scala data structures and algorithms for graphs, trees and heaps.
=============


QuickSort
--------
- swap elements in array
- should partition array
- should sort array with each strategy
- should choose median
- should sort dataset using `first` partitioning stategy
- should sort dataset using `last` partitioning stategy
- should sort dataset using `median` partitioning stategy
- should sort dataset using `random` partitioning stategy

Heap
--------
- should calculate left, right and parent element index
- should insert element while maintaining min-heap property
- should insert element while maintaining max-heap property
- should extract head while maintaining heap property
- should remove element while maintaining heap property
- should compute sum of moving medians

Graph
--------
- should have nodes and edges
- should have hardCopyReversed graph
- should search graph with dfs
- should find strongly connected components
- should read adjacent list graph from file
- should read adjacent-weight list graph from file
- should breath-first search the graph - sccGraph
- should depth-first search the graph - dijkstraGraph
- should depth-first search the graph - sccGraph
- should find cycles - graph2
- should find cycles - graph3
- should check cycles
- should sort topologically - graph3
- should sort topologically - graph4
- should compute shortest path - graph3
- should compute shortest path - dijkstraData
- should compute all shortest paths - graph3
- should compute all shortest paths - dijkstraData
- should merge nodes
- should find min cut count
- should find strongly connected components - scc
